## ⚠️ **BUILD ISSUES (Need Resolution)**

### 🔧 **Current Build Problems**
1. **Framer Motion Compatibility**: Animation prop conflicts in UI components
2. **Missing CLI Integration**: Some advanced features reference incomplete modules
3. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Some interfaces need refinement

### 🎯 **Two Deployment Strategies**

#### **Strategy 1: Quick Production Deploy (Recommended)**
**Timeline: 1-2 days**

**Remove/Disable Advanced Features Temporarily:**
- Comment out CLI integration features
- Disable advanced video processing options
- Use basic video upload/processing only
- Keep all working features (auth, admin, payments)

**Result**: Fully functional SaaS with core features ready for users

#### **Strategy 2: Complete Feature Implementation**
**Timeline: 1-2 weeks**

**Fix All Advanced Features:**
- Complete CLI integration
- Fix all TypeScript issues
- Implement full video processing pipeline
- Add all planned features

**Result**: Full-featured platform with all bells and whistles
